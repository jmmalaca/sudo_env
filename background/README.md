## Background image
This has been my background image from some time now and honestly... why change ;)
So, on this repo there is a `background` folder having that image that is copied
to `~/.background/` folder when the `dots` files are instaled. Next, when the `osx` script runs, it sets this image as my background image. Change this if you like.
