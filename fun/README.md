## Fun stuff
Here is a make file to install some fun stuff we can have on our terminals.

It will install:
* ````bash
cowsay Hello
```` It will print on your terminal a cow saying Hello
* ````bash
fortune
```` It will print on your terminal a random fortune message
* ````bash
cowsay Hello | lolcat
```` or ````bash
fortune | lolcat
```` It will put some color on the text
* ````bash
cmatrix
```` It will transform you console to a matrix screen like the movie.

Simple things just for fun.
